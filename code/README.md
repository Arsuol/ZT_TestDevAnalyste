# Codes

## test1
quickanddirty  
first machine learning code  
try to tweek code from 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ to 
work with our problem  

Not working: can't work with strings, need to work with numeric values

## test2 
encode strings to numeric values (character by character)  
from https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-character-based-neural-language-model-keras/

## test3
encoding clear and obfuscated data.  
note: using the same encoding for both files

## test4
working featureless Machine Learning examples
using multiple models and comparing them
